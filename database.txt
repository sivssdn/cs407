1. vehicles collection
[
{
"_id" : ObjectId("asjhg5"),
"departure_date" : date,
"departure_time" : time,
"source" : "place",
"destination" : "destination_place",
"vehicle_identification" : "number or name",
"total_seats" : number, #without driver
"price" : number,
"owner": user id,
"passengers" : [ 
		{
			"user_id" : "id_from_occupant_table",
			"booking_time" : "time"
		},
		{
			"user_id" : "id_from_occupant_table",
			"booking_time" : "time"
		}
	]
},
{...}
]

2. users collection
[
{
"_id" : ObjectId("asjhg15"),
"email" : "abc@g.c",
"contact" : "number",
"department" : "department string"
},
{
"_id" : ObjectId("a45sjhg5"),
"email" : "abc@g.c",
"contact" : "number",
"department" : "department string"
}
]

Mongo DB does not have a fixed schema, it can have different attibutes for different records in the same collection. "_id" object is default primary key and unique. Relationships between collections are called reference and is done with $ref variable and has no constraints like foreign key.


db.vehicles.insert({
"departure_date" : "date",
"departure_time" : "time",
"source" : "place",
"destination" : "destination_place",
"vehicle_identification" : "number or name",
"total_seats" : 2, 
"price" : 100,
"owner": "user id",
"passengers" : [ 
		{
			"user_id" : "id_from_occupant_table",
			"booking_time" : "time"
		},
		{
			"user_id" : "id_from_occupant_table",
			"booking_time" : "time"
		}
	]
})
